This project implements drivers for the lis3dh accelerometer and the neopixel matrix using the ws2812 protocol. Provided is an example program which uses them to create a bubble level. To create the project from the root run "mkdir build && cd build && export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk && cmake -DPICO_BOARD=adafruit_feather_rp2040 .. && cmake .. && make" where you replace path/to/pico-sdk with your path. This will generate a uf2 file in the created build directory to program to your board. The level sensitivity makes it very difficult to get the bubble to go into the corners but it otherwise works as expected
